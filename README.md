# Walking Delirium

## Synopsis

- This workshop focuses on following a lecture example and experimenting with my paintings. The main goal is to understand how this coding concept works and apply it to one of my paintings. In the future, I would like to disintegrate the paintings and make elements move around, similar to creating a short film animation using code.

## Summary/Problem-solving

- I started the task by using the provided example and familiarizing myself with the codes that were relevant for this workshop. 

- After watching the class video from
- https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/121821/pages/week-1-overview?module_item_id=2435967,

- I decided to begin my project by copying the lecture's code and modifying it to fit my ideas.

- My objective was to replace the dot example we discussed in class with images.

- I explored several websites, but the one that helped me the most was
- https://youtu.be/yBVeCXnxQYs.

- I followed the video closely, which clarified how to use the Walker function in relation to my concept.

- Photoshop work was neccesary on Images.

- Based on that video, I developed a basic code that allowed me to move my images.

- However, I encountered a problem: I couldn't move the images in different directions. I knew I needed to enable movement, so I experimented with altering the x and y coordinates, which proved helpful.

- Then, I contemplated using timing or setting intervals. I realized that if my example involved a car or a bus, I needed to incorporate elements that described that movement, such as speed.

- I followed the p5.js example related to speed, but I eventually became confused about what was wrong with my code. So I went to look for samples.

- After trying few samples I got a decent code, but I need to ask for assistance. 

- I reached out to Meta for assistance, which provided a response. I appreciated that it presented my code in a clearer manner; however, its example did not work as expected.

- <img width="345" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 5 45 15 pm" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71699379-5a4f-4713-bf0d-21e6be8feb92" />


- On the plus side, it highlighted important aspects, such as how to use speed correctly and how to make an object move in the opposite direction, which was crucial for my project.

- After fixing the coding issues, I encountered another problem: my image did not appear correctly.

- <img width="1728" alt="a" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2152489b-60b5-4610-98e5-eeeef31ba890" />


- Therefore, I asked Meta for help again and finally realized that the same issue applied to another example of mine—the background needed to be manipulated within the draw loop to clear it, allowing the image to display properly.

- In the end, I worked through the example effectively and gained a wealth of information, especially regarding key concepts like speed and motion.

## Future development

- I want to improve my drawings because animation is crucial for this. This exercise has significantly helped me understand how my drawings can come to life.

## Conclusion

- In conclusion, I believe that Meta has helped me understand various concepts and find the right path for seeking information. I also recognize that while Meta is free to use, it can sometimes provide incorrect answers, so it's always a good idea to verify the information.

- I must mention that this project did not require extensive research, as it focused more on developing a concept to express using the previous code from the class.

- My work
